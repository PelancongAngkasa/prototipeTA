organisms: Organisms are groups of molecules and atoms that form a complete functional section of your application. For instance, a login form with input fields, a button, and error messages.
templates: Templates define the layout and structure of a specific page or view. They assemble organisms and molecules into a cohesive user interface.
pages: Pages represent the final screens or views that users interact with. They utilize templates and contain minimal logic, serving as the entry point for data retrieval and manipulation.
